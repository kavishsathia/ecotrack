# EcoTrack: Sustainable Shopping Intelligence Platform

## 🌱 Project Overview

EcoTrack is a comprehensive sustainability platform that empowers consumers to make environmentally conscious purchasing decisions while generating valuable data for evidence-based policy making. The platform combines real-time product sustainability scoring, lifecycle tracking, and gamified user engagement to drive behavioral change at scale.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **Consumer Challenge**: 68% of consumers want to make sustainable choices but lack accessible, reliable information at point of purchase
- **Data Gap**: Governments and organizations lack real-time consumer behavior data for effective sustainability policy
- **Lifecycle Blind Spot**: Current solutions only address purchasing decisions, missing the critical usage and disposal phases
- **Trust Issue**: Existing sustainability claims are often greenwashed or unverified

## 💡 Solution: The EcoTrack Ecosystem

### Core Components

#### 1. Chrome Extension (Primary Interface)
- **Real-time sustainability scoring** on e-commerce platforms (starting with Shopee)
- **Material composition analysis** extracted from product descriptions
- **Alternative product recommendations** with better sustainability scores
- **One-click purchase tracking** for lifecycle monitoring

#### 2. Web Dashboard (Data Intelligence)
- **Personal sustainability analytics** showing individual impact over time
- **Product lifecycle tracking** with milestone-based check-ins
- **Community insights** comparing user behavior and outcomes
- **Points and rewards system** for sustained engagement

#### 3. Mobile App (Future Phase)
